# Why learn Javascript?

## Community

Javascript encompasses a gigantic community of developers. This makes it easier to find what you need or to get involved with other projects.

## The Frontend and backend speak the same language!

This perhaps the greatest benefit to learning Javascript. You can use the same language for both the front and backend of your application stack.
