# &lt;!DOCTYPE>

Each HTML document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE>` DTD or the Document Type Definition.

Doctype is not an HTML tag. It tells the browser which type of document to expect.
If it is not declared you can expect inconsistencies across browsers.

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Document Title</title>
</head>

<body>
Content
</body>

</html>
